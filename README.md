# ProtonDrive Linux Client

This is the repository for the ProtonDrive Linux Client. The goal of this project is to provide a native Linux client for ProtonDrive, allowing users to seamlessly access and manage their encrypted files.

**Important Note:** This repository is currently under active development. The application on the `main` branch is not functional and should not be considered stable.

Development is ongoing in the `alpha` and `dev` branches. Please refer to those branches for the latest progress, but be aware that neither branch is fully working yet.

We are working hard to bring a stable and functional ProtonDrive Linux client to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience!
