# API Documentation

This section provides comprehensive documentation for the ProtonDrive Linux Client's internal APIs and external interfaces.

The full API documentation is generated automatically using TypeDoc from the project's source code. You can view the generated documentation by building the project or browsing the hosted version (if available).

## How to Generate API Docs Locally

To generate the API documentation on your local machine, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
npm run docs:api
```

The generated documentation will be available in the `docs/api/` directory.
