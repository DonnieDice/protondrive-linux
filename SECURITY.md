# Security Policy

The security of the ProtonDrive Linux client is a top priority. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to working with the community to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities that are reported to us. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please use the **private vulnerability reporting feature** provided by GitHub.

To submit a report:

1.  Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2.  Under the repository name, click the **Security** tab.
3.  In the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click **Report a Vulnerability**.
4.  Fill out the form with the details of the vulnerability. Please provide as much information as possible, including:
    *   The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).
    *   Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue.
    *   The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL).
    *   Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue.
    *   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
    *   Proof-of-concept or exploit code.
    *   Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it.

This will allow us to assess the risk and work on a fix in a private setting.

## Our Commitment

If you use this process, we commit to:

-   Responding to your report promptly, typically within 72 hours.
-   Providing an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
-   Notifying you when the vulnerability is fixed.
-   Publicly acknowledging your responsible disclosure (if you wish).

Thank you for helping keep ProtonDrive Linux and its users safe.
